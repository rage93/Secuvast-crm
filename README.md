## Company Sign-Up


Only the first administrator should create an account using the company signâ€‘up page:

```
/company/signup/
```


During sign up the user account and the company are created in one step. After
registration you are redirected to the pricing page to select a plan and
complete payment via Stripe. Additional members are invited from the
administration area once signed in.


The full onboarding flow works as follows:

1. Visit the landing page and choose **Create Company**.
2. Fill out the signâ€‘up form which creates both the user and the company.
3. Pick a plan on the pricing page and complete payment when required.
4. After checkout you are taken straight to your company dashboard.
5. Invite additional members from the *Company â†’ Users* section.

You can also start from the public pricing page. Choosing a plan there will
lead you to the signâ€‘up form with the plan preselected.


When running locally, add entries to your `hosts` file so subdomains resolve to
`127.0.0.1` (e.g. `myco.localhost`). After authentication, users are
automatically redirected to their company subdomain.


## Auto Reload with Docker

To develop locally with hotâ€‘reload enabled, the Docker services mount the
project directory and run the application with reload flags. Start the stack
using:

```bash
docker compose up
```


The `appseed-app` container runs `python manage.py migrate` on startup so new
database tables are created automatically. If running the project outside of
Docker, remember to apply migrations manually with `python manage.py migrate`.


Whenever you modify the code, the web service reloads via Django's runserver
and the Celery worker restarts thanks to `watchmedo`.

## Data Integrity

Each `Company` row tracks a `row_version` that increments on every update. If
two sessions attempt to modify the same company concurrently, a validation
error prevents overwriting stale data.

When using PostgreSQL, row-level security restricts queries so that tenants can
only access their own records. The middleware sets the database parameter
`secuvast.current_company` for each request.

The admin change view now displays related audit logs so you can review changes
to a company at a glance. Superusers can switch between tenants via a new
dropdown in the admin header.

## Test Data

Default role permissions live in `fixtures/role_matrix.yml`. Sync them with:

```bash
python manage.py sync_roles
```

Run tests using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest
```

Admins can manage their subscription via Stripe's billing portal:

```bash
https://<company>.localhost/company/billing/
```

Generate demo data locally with:

```bash
python scripts/make_demo_data.py
```
